Always conform to the Angular Best Practices defined in angular-19-best-practices.md in folder promps/angular-19-best-practices.md when generating code.
Always conform to the Angular Performance defined in angular-performance.md in folder promps/angular-performance.md when generating code.
Always conform to the Commit Message Convention defined in commit-message-convention.md in folder promps/commit-message-convention.md when generating commit messages.
Always use Angular Jest for unit testing.
Always use Angular Latests version with standalone.
Always use Tailwind CSS to style the components.
Always compare other HTML files before apply the styles to follow the same pattern.
Always use Angular Testing Library for testing components.
Always use Angular Storybook for component documentation.
Always use Playwright for end-to-end testing.
Always use NX CLI for generating components, services, etc.
Always use Angular GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
Always use Angular Firebase for backend services.
In TypeScript always use underscore for private field names.
Always use TypeScript `as const` to define enums for a set of named constants, and then use TypeScript utility types or mapped types to derive the corresponding type from the enum. This approach ensures type safety and avoids the pitfalls of traditional enums.
Always prefer using TypeScript `type` aliases over `interface` for defining object shapes, as `type` provides more flexibility and supports advanced features like union types and intersections.  
Always leverage TypeScript generics to create reusable, type-safe components or functions, ensuring flexibility and strong type inference across different use cases.
Always use TypeScript utility types for common transformations like `Partial`, `Pick`, and `Omit`.
Always use TypeScript `readonly` modifier for immutable properties.
Always use TypeScript `Record` type for mapping keys to values.
Always use TypeScript `unknown` instead of `any` for safer type assertions.
Always use TypeScript `as const` for literal type inference.
Always use TypeScript `keyof` and `typeof` operators for advanced type manipulations.
Always use TypeScript `NonNullable` type to exclude `null` and `undefined`.
Always organize modules and components by feature in the `apps` and `libs` directories.
Always use the `libs` directory for shared utilities, services, and components.
Always follow NX's recommended folder structure for scalability and maintainability.
Always group related components, services, and modules in the same library.
Always document the purpose of each library in the `README.md` file within the library folder.
Always use NX's tagging system to enforce module boundaries.
